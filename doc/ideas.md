# Stages

## Germination
use stashed Sugar to grow enough roots for two leaves

## Growth
grow more leaves to be able to grow flower

## Reproduction and Pollination
grow flowers that must be pollinated
- by a bee (when near a bee, distance can be greater with Attraction ability)
- by wind (when in high altitude, altitude can be lowered by Windtrap ability)

pollinated flowers produce seeds

## Seed Spreading

- by flowing water
- by wind
- by fruit eaters

# Body parts

- seed (food storage - cotyledon)
- root system
- stem (upper and lower epidermis)
- leaves (chloroplasts do photosynthesis)
- flowers/fruits

# Photosynthesis

energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars

Transpiration â€“ the loss of water vapor to cool the plant

# Regeneration

Regenerate eaten parts or even repel bugs

# Achievements

- flower is symmetric
- finish in a time limit (n. of rounds/steps)
