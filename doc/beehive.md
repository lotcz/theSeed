TODO:
=====

- non-saved sprites (hints, )
- placeable hints
- sprite placement (drop to ground gravity-like)
- dynamic ground (make pieces disappear or be replaced)
- dying animals
- some minerals flow on water
- json editor
- emitters will not spawn if something is present
- emitters can be configured to spawn certain amount (custom data)
- limit inventory, slow down when carrying too much
- slow when in cloud or on water (by adding visible burden)
- add exit image and shrink bee when exiting
- make edges of level work as an exit
- bubbles turn to water on surface and can be collected
- ground rendering order (to fix water underground)
- different properties of ground in terms of bouncing, hurting and crawling
- impenetrable sprites (e.g. water drops)
- lives/followers
- add diagonal directions?
- build experimental levels

Sprites

- penetrable
- takeable
- striking/hurting
