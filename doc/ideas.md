# Biotopes

- water
- rich
- poor
- snow

# Stages

- seed placement
- germination (use stashed Sugar to grow enough roots for two leaves)
- growth (grow more leaves to be able to grow flower)
- reproduction and pollination (grow flowers that must be pollinated, pollinated flowers produce seeds)
- seed spreading
  - by flowing water
  - by wind
  - by fruit eaters

# Body parts

- seed (food storage - cotyledon)
- root system
- stem (upper and lower epidermis)
- leaves (chloroplasts do photosynthesis)
- flowers/fruits

# Photosynthesis

energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars

Transpiration â€“ the loss of water vapor to cool the plant

# Perks

- grow roots horizontally or even upwards
- grow stem horizontally or even downwards
- join with roots with own plant or even parasite on roots of another plant
- grow harder and taller stem
- carnivorous
- regenerate eaten parts or even repel bugs
- by a bee (when near a bee, distance can be greater with Attraction ability)
- by wind (when in high altitude, altitude can be lowered by Windtrap ability)


# Achievements

- flower is symmetric
- finish in a time limit (n. of rounds/steps)
